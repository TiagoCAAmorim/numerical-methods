    abstract = "{The compressibility of reservoir rock is a factor which is generally neglected in reservoir engineering calculations. This is due in part to the fact that there is little published information on rock compressibility values for limestones and sandstones. Omission of rock compressibility is undoubtedly justified in calculations for saturated reservoirs; however, in undersaturated reservoirs, expansion of the rock accompanying decline in the reservoir pressure may be of such magnitude as to affect materially the prediction of reservoir performance. The effect of rock compressibility will be of most importance in:calculation of oil in place by pressure decline data in undersaturated volumetric reservoirs when the limits of the field are unknown or indefinite, and studies of natural water drive performance.To estimate its importance in such cases, a series of laboratory tests were made to obtain usable values for reservoir rock compressibility.The total, or effective, compressibility of any reservoir rock is a result of two separate factors, namely, expansion of the individual rock grains, as the surrounding fluid pressure decreases, and the additional formation compaction brought about because the reservoir fluids become less effective in opposing the weight of the overburden as reservoir pressure declines. Both of these factors tend to decrease porosity. The laboratory tests were conducted in a manner that would give compressibility values representing a combination of the two factors, and would, as nearly as possible, duplicate the behavior of the rock under reservoir conditions. Fig. 1 shows a diagram of the equipment used to determine rock compressibility. The rocks used in these tests were cores cut from producing limestone and sandstone formations. They were from 2 to 3 1/2 in. in diameter, and 5 to 6 in.long. A core to be tested was completely surrounded by a Lucite jacket with the exception of the connection at one end to allow production of liquid during testing. To represent the effect of the overburden, a constant external hydrostatic pressure of 3,000 psig was applied to the core throughout the test.(The amount of external pressure was varied in a series of tests and no change was evidenced in the measured compressibility values.) Starting at approximately 1,500 psi static fluid pressure in the core, the core pressure was reduced by steps of 100 to 200 psi. Precise measurement of liquid production was made for each decrease in pressure.T.N. 149}",

This chapter presents the mathematical relationships designed to describe flow behavior of reservoir fluids. The isothermal compressibility coefficient is essentially the controlling factor in identifying the type of the reservoir fluid. The flow regime is identified as a steady-state flow if the pressure at every location in the reservoir remains constant. The fluid flow equations are used to describe flow behavior in a reservoir which can take many forms depending upon the combination of variables presented. It is observed that when several fluid phases are flowing simultaneously in a horizontal porous system, the concept of the effective permeability of each phase and the associated physical properties can be used in Darcy's equation. The constant-terminal-pressure solution is designed to provide the cumulative flow at any particular time for a reservoir in which the pressure at one boundary of the reservoir is held constant. The pressure derivative method and analysis of middle-time test data are also analyzed.}

    abstract = "{For several years the authors have felt the need for a source from which reservoir engineers could obtain fundamental theory and data on the flow off luids through permeable media in the unsteady state. The data on the unsteady state flow are composed of solutions of the equation(Equation).Two sets of solutions of this equation are developed, namely, for "the constant terminal pressure case" and "the constant terminal rate case." In the constant terminal pressure case the pressure at the terminal boundary is lowered by unity at zero time, kept constant thereafter, and the cumulative amount of fluid flowing across the boundary is computed, as a function of the time. In the constant terminal rate case a unit rate of production is made to flow across the terminal boundary (from time zero onward)and the ensuing pressure drop is computed as a function of the time. Considerable effort has been made to compile complete tables from which curves can be constructed for the constant terminal pressure and constant termina lrate cases, both for finite and infinite reservoirs. These curves can be employed to reproduce the effect of any pressure or rate history encountered in practice. Most of the information is obtained by the help of the Laplace transformations, which proved to be extremely helpful for analyzing the problems encountered in fluid flow. The application of this method simplifies the more tedious mathematical analyses employed in the past. With the help of Laplace transformations some original developments were obtained (and presented) which could not have been easily foreseen by the earlier methods. This paper represents a compilation of the work done over the past few years on the flow of fluid in porous media. It concerns itself primarily with the transient conditions prevailing in oil reservoirs during the time they are produced. The study is limited to conditions where the flow of fluid obeys the diffusivity equation. Multiple-phase fluid flow has not been considered.T.P. 2732}",

    abstract = "{The pore-volume compressibilities and porosities presented here were derived from 256 samples of sandstone and limestone representing 40 reservoirs. These and previously published data are in poor agreement with compressibility-porosity correlations in the literature. The salient conclusion is that to evaluate rock compressibility for a given reservoir it is necessary to measure compressibility in the laboratory.The use of pore-volume compressibility-porosity correlations in engineering calculations is well known. The correlations developed by Hall for both sandstones and limestones have been widely distributed. Van der Knaap published a similar correlation using limestone samples from a single well and also correlated the data with net pressure. Such correlations are attractive because of the simple relationship established. However, those correlations were intended only for well consolidated samples; correlations for friable or unconsolidated samples have not been published. This study compares our laboratory data with the published correlations of consolidated samples as published correlations of consolidated samples as well as with values for friable and unconsolidated sandstones. Compressibility values are presented for 256 rock samples from 40 reservoirs - 197 samples from 29 sandstone reservoirs and 59 samples from 11 limestone reservoirs. Porosities ranged from less than 1 percent to 35 percent. Compressibility values from the literature for 79 samples are added, including Hall's and Van der Knaap's.To obtain a representative sample of a formation for testing, one must avoid grain rearrangement. This problem is unlikely to occur with consolidated problem is unlikely to occur with consolidated samples or friable samples containing some cementation, although the effect of removing the overburden is still unknown. Unconsolidated samples, on the other hand, present a much more complex problem, in that grain rearrangement is very likely during either coring or subsequent handling. The advent of the rubber-sleeve core barrel much improved the chances of obtaining, representative samples. We have some evidence that, if carefully handled. rubber-sleeve cores will provide reasonably undisturbed samples. However, even if the sand is captured undisturbed in the rubber sleeve, internal gas can expand the core during the trip to the surface. The history of all the samples used in this study is not complete, but most of the unconsolidated samples were obtained from rubber-sleeve cores.Preparing the Samples Preparing the Samples The consolidated and friable samples used in this study were generally plugs 1 in. in diameter and 3 in. long, and their condition ranged from well preserved to dry and weathered. The core plugs were extracted in solvent to remove water and hydrocarbons, put into a flexible jacket, and saturated with a refined oil. The unconsolidated samples of about the same dimensions were generally cored from rubber-sleeve cores that had been frozen in liquid nitrogen and for which liquid nitrogen had been used as a drilling fluid. The frozen samples were placed in a Teflon sleeve and allowed to thaw. End plates and screens were then placed on the ends of the samples.JPTP. 129}",
