    abstract = "{The minimum curvature method has emerged as the accepted industry standard for the calculation of 3D directional surveys. Using this model, the well's trajectory is represented by a series of circular arcs and straight lines. Collections of other points, lines and planes can be used to represent features such as adjacent wells, lease lines, geological targets and faults. The relationships between these objects have simple geometrical interpretations, making them amenable to mathematical treatment. The calculations are now used extensively in 3D imaging and directional collision scans, making them both business and safety critical. However, references for the calculations are incomplete, scattered in the literature and have no systematic mathematical treatment. These features make programming a consistent and reliable set of algorithms more difficult. Increased standardisation is needed.Investigation shows that iterative schemes have been used where explicit solutions are possible. Explicit calculations are preferred because they confer numerical predictability and stability. Though vector methods were frequently adopted in the early stages of the published derivations, opportunities for simplification were missed because of premature translation to Cartesian coordinates.This paper contains a compendium of algorithms based on the minimum curvature method (includes co-ordinate reference frames, toolface, interpolation, intersection with a target plane, minimum and maximum TVD in a horizontal section, point closest to a circular arc, survey station to a target position with and without the direction defined, nudges and steering runs). Consistent, vector methods have been used throughout with improvements in mathematical efficiency, stability and predictability of behaviour. The resulting algorithms are also simpler and more cost effective to code and test. This paper describes the practical context in which each of the algorithms is applied and enumerates some key tests that need to be performed.}",

    abstract = "{Reservoir simulation has been in practice for more than 50 years, but it has recently gained significant momentum because of its wider application to the increasingly complex reservoir systems of today. Reservoir Simulation: Problems and Solutions provides petroleum engineers with extensive practice in the art of problem solving, strengthening their critical-thinking solution strategies, and preparing them for the unique problems they will encounter in this dynamic field. Built on the fundamental concepts and solutions of the original exercises found in Basic Applied Reservoir Simulation (Turgay Ertekin, Jamal H. Abou-Kassem, and Gregory R. King), this new book provides an additional 180 exercises and solutions that fully illustrate the intricacies of reservoir-simulation methodology.}",

    abstract = "{Integrated production systems models are very valuable for predicting the performance of complex systems containing multiple reservoirs and networks. In addition, the value of quantifying uncertainty in reservoirs and production systems is immense as it can build confidence in operational investments. However, traditionally it has been extremely tedious to incorporate uncertainty assessments in the context of integrated production systems modelling. This has been addressed in the current work with the help of a case study.In the current work, a complex integrated production systems model is presented - from Pre-Salt carbonates reservoir offshore of Brazil. The model includes multiple reservoirs with unique fluid types and complex fluid blending in the production network, multiphase and thermal effects in flowlines and risers, gas separation, gas processing, gas compression, and re-injection for either pressure maintenance or for miscible EOR.The operational strategies, well placement, and well and network configurations are often based on a single geological realization. With the case study presented in this paper, an integrated way of quantifying geological uncertainty has been presented. A new multi-user, multi-disciplinary tool was used for this study that removed any discontinuities and inconsistencies that typically occur in such projects when multiple standalone tools are used for individual tasks. When quantifying uncertainty on production, the dependence on a single realization was eliminated as uncertain parameters were identified and used for creating robust probabilistic forecasts. Probability distribution curves were generated to represent the uncertainty in overall production from this asset, and the risk associated with operational investments was minimized.Typically, an end-to-end uncertainty assessment is missing from the traditional Integrated Modelling workflows. With this new approach, the challenge of achieving a truly integrated uncertainty assessment for integrated reservoir and production models has been addressed successfully.}",
