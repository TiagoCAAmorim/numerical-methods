Code for IM253 (Numerical Methods) exercises and final project.

## Timeline

### **2023.08**

* Bissection method to find root of 1D functions.
  * Implemented Minimum Curvature Method as a practical example to be tested.
  * Managed to converge in all tests.
* Newton Raphson method to find root of 1D functions.
  * Developed derivative of the Inverse of the Minimum Curvatura Method.
  * Included Mathematica notebook with formulas and additional tests.
* Reports (in Portuguese) of all exercises.

### **2023.09**

* Secant method to find root of 1D functions.
  * Better results than Newton-Raphson.
  * iMCM is close to a straight line, and Secant yielded better results because it uses a _mean_ derivative. First iteration already gives very good results.
